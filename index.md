¹ This table doesn't take into account the redistribution of seats planned for the 2019 European election.

² France has changed its electoral system since the last election; current assumption is that it will use the D'Hondt method without a threshold.

The following countries haven't been included in the calculations yet,
 and are therefore, except for the United Kingdom, represented with the fixed numbers
 42 seats for EPP,
 26 seats for S&D,
 13 seats for ECR,
 26 seats for ALDE,
 8 seats for GUE/NGL,
 9 seats for Greens/EFA,
 1 seat for EFDD,
 and none for ENF and NI in the results above:
