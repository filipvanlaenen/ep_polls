² France has changed its electoral system since the last election; current assumption is that it will use the D'Hondt method with a 5% threshold.

 and are therefore, except for the United Kingdom, represented with the fixed numbers
 8 seats for EPP,
 4 seats for S&D,
 5 seats for ALDE,
 3 seats for GUE/NGL,
 and none for Greens/EFA, ECR, EFDD, ENF and NI in the results above:
