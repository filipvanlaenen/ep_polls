² France has changed its electoral system since the last election; current assumption is that it will use the D'Hondt method with a 5% threshold.

The following countries haven't been included in the calculations yet,
 and are therefore, except for the United Kingdom, represented with the fixed numbers
 9 seats for EPP,
 6 seats for S&D,
 7 seats for ALDE,
 4 seats for GUE/NGL,
 2 seats for Greens/EFA,
 and none for ECR, EFDD, ENF and NI in the results above:
